# 2DMapGen_2023

Yet more experiments in generating 2d images that might vaguely resemble a map

## Some notes

Running the Main.tscn on this project will allow the user to select a sub scene to load and run from a set of sub directories.
Sub scenes can be grouped by directory and are loaded after start-up.
Each sub scene is implemented as a TextureRect with a script attached, the idea is simply for scratching up approaches that may (or may not) be used in some form of content generation, with a particular emphasis on two dimensional map generation.
